# 🚀 Mastering iOS Development: SwiftUI Roadmap  

Welcome to the **Mastering iOS Development** journey! This roadmap is designed to help you build a strong foundation in iOS development, focusing entirely on **SwiftUI** during the initial stages.  

---

## 🗺️ Roadmap Overview  

### 📖 Phase 1: Core Foundations (SwiftUI-Centric)  

#### 1. Master Swift Basics  
- **Swift Fundamentals**:  
  - Variables, constants, data types  
  - Control flow: `if`, `switch`, loops  
  - Functions and closures  
- **Object-Oriented Programming**:  
  - Classes, structs, enums  
  - Protocols and extensions  
- **Modern Swift Features**:  
  - Optionals, error handling  
  - Concurrency (`async/await`, `Task`)  

💻 **Practice**: Build small programs, like a tip calculator.  

#### 2. SwiftUI Essentials  
- **Learn the Basics**:  
  - `View`, `Text`, `Image`, `VStack`, `HStack`, `ZStack`  
  - Styling with modifiers  
- **State Management**:  
  - `@State`, `@Binding`, `@EnvironmentObject`  
- **Navigation**:  
  - NavigationStack and NavigationLink  
- **Reusable Components**:  
  - Custom `View`s  

💻 **Practice**: Create a to-do list app.  

#### 3. Understand State and Data Flow  
- **SwiftUI State Management**:  
  - `@State`, `@ObservedObject`, `@EnvironmentObject`  
- **MVVM Architecture**:  
  - Separate business logic into a `ViewModel`  

💻 **Practice**: Refactor the to-do list app using MVVM.  

#### 4. Advanced SwiftUI Layouts  
- **Master Layout Containers**:  
  - Grids (`LazyVGrid`, `LazyHGrid`)  
  - Lists with sections  
- **Animations**:  
  - Implicit/explicit animations, transitions  
- **Styling**:  
  - Custom modifiers, dynamic theming  

💻 **Practice**: Build a weather app with animations.  

#### 5. Networking with SwiftUI  
- Fetch API data using `URLSession`.  
- Decode JSON with `Codable`.  
- Display loading states and handle errors gracefully.  

💻 **Practice**: Build an app to display data from a public API (e.g., GitHub repos).  

#### 6. SwiftUI and Data Persistence  
- Save data with `@AppStorage` and `@SceneStorage`.  
- Work with `FileManager` for file handling.  
- Explore Core Data integration with SwiftUI.  

💻 **Practice**: Create a notes app with persistent storage.  

#### 7. Testing and Debugging  
- Write UI tests with Xcode.  
- Debug using Xcode Previews and Instruments.  

💻 **Practice**: Add tests to your to-do list or notes app.

## 🛠️ Final Project Idea  

**Build a Personal Organizer App**:  
1. **Home Screen**: Display daily tasks in a horizontal card layout.  
2. **Tasks Section**: Add, edit, and delete tasks.  
3. **Notes Section**: Write notes with rich text support.  
4. **Profile Section**: Add a profile picture using `PhotosPicker`.
